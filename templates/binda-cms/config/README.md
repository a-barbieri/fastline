# %%PROJECT_NAME%%

A Rails application with Binda CMS.

## Installation

Generate a rails skeleton using the provided template file.

```
docker-compose run web rails new . -m template.rb --force --database=postgresql
```

Now that every file is in place you can create the containers:

```
docker-compose up -d

```

If allâ€™s well, you should see some PostgreSQL output.
```
rails_db_1 is up-to-date
Creating rails_web_1 ... done
Attaching to rails_db_1, rails_web_1
db_1   | PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.
db_1   |
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.437 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv4 address "0.0.0.0", port 5432
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.437 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv6 address "::", port 5432
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.443 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on Unix socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.726 UTC [55] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2018-03-21 20:18:37 UTC
db_1   | 2018-03-21 20:18:37.772 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

Finally, you need to create the database. run:

```
docker-compose run web rails db:create
```

Here is an example of the output from that command:

```
$ docker-compose run web rails db:create
Starting rails_db_1 ... done
Created database 'myapp_development'
Created database 'myapp_test'
```

### View the Rails welcome page!
Your app should now be running on port 3000 on your Docker daemon.
